## Tips & Tricks

### Create a Table of Contents

1. Add headings throughout your document
2. Create links to those headings using `#heading-id` format
3. Heading IDs are automatically generated (lowercase, with hyphens)
   - "Getting Started" becomes `#getting-started`
   - "Tips & Tricks" becomes `#tips-tricks`

### Organize with Folders

- Create folders for different projects or topics
- Drag files between folders to reorganize
- Right-click folders for quick actions (new file, rename, delete)

### Work Faster with Shortcuts

- Learn a few key shortcuts (`Cmd+B`, `Cmd+I`, `Cmd+K`) to speed up formatting
- Use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to indent/outdent list items quickly
- Press `Cmd+1` and `Cmd+2` to switch between edit and code modes

### Make Links Clickable

- In Edit mode: Hold `Cmd` and click a link to follow it
- In Code mode: Just click the link in the preview pane
- External links open in your default browser

### Clean Up Unused Images

- Go to **File > Clean Up Unused Images**
- MarkNotes removes images that aren't used in any notes
- Keeps your `.assets` folder tidy

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are my notes stored?

All notes are saved in `~/Documents/MarkNotes/` as plain `.md` (markdown) files. You can access them directly from Finder anytime.

### Can I use my notes with other apps?

Yes! MarkNotes uses standard markdown files. You can edit them in any text editor, view them on GitHub, or use them with other markdown apps.

### Does MarkNotes sync to the cloud?

No, MarkNotes is local-only by design. This keeps your notes private and fast. If you want cloud backup, you can:

- Use iCloud to sync your Documents folder
- Copy the MarkNotes folder to Dropbox or similar
- Use Git to version control your notes

### Can I customize the appearance?

MarkNotes follows your system dark/light mode by default. You can also toggle between modes from the Activity Bar or **View > Dark Mode / Light Mode**. The sidebar width is adjustable by dragging the divider.

### What about Windows or Linux?

MarkNotes is currently macOS-only, but the technology (Electron) supports other platforms. Windows and Linux versions may be added in the future.

### How do I backup my notes?

Your notes are just files in `~/Documents/MarkNotes/`. You can:

- Use Time Machine (automatic on macOS)
- Copy the folder to an external drive
- Use cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
- Use Git for version control

### Is my data safe?

Yes! MarkNotes:

- Never sends data anywhere (no internet connection needed)
- Doesn't collect any analytics or telemetry
- Auto-saves every 5 seconds to prevent data loss
- Stores everything as plain text files you control

---

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't open

- Make sure you're running macOS 10.15 or later
- Try moving MarkNotes to your Applications folder
- Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy if macOS blocks it

### My files aren't showing up

- Look in `~/Documents/MarkNotes/` in Finder to verify files exist
- Click the sidebar toggle button in the Activity Bar (`Cmd+.`) if the sidebar is hidden
- Only `.md` files are shown (other file types are filtered out)

### Auto-save isn't working

- Check that you have write permissions for `~/Documents/MarkNotes/`
- Look at the status bar - it shows "Saving..." when auto-saving
- Force save with `Cmd+S` to test if saving works at all

### Tables look wrong

- Make sure your table has a header row with separators (`| --- |`)
- Try switching to Code mode (`Cmd+2`) and back to Edit mode (`Cmd+1`)
- Check that cells don't have conflicting formatting

### Images aren't showing

- Images are stored in the `.assets/` folder next to your notes
- Make sure images are in supported formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WEBP)
- Check file permissions in the `.assets/` folder

### PDF export isn't working

- Make sure you have write permissions in your chosen save location
- Check that you have enough disk space
- Try exporting to a different location (like Desktop)

### Testing

MarkNotes uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing with separate environments for the main (Node.js) and renderer (jsdom) processes.

```bash
# Run all tests (204 tests)
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# With coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Main process only
npm run test:main

# Renderer process only
npm run test:renderer
```

Or use the shell script:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh [--coverage] [--main] [--renderer] [--watch]
```

**Test coverage (v1.9.8):** 86% overall — covering path security, file CRUD, search, markdown conversion (HTML↔MD), YAML frontmatter processing, and Zustand store.
